- converted raw txt transcript to csv after parsing this txt file via regex and 
converting into data frame with Pandas
- trained the model via girls github "model_train..." https://github.com/RuolinZheng08/twewy-discord-chatbot
- trained with GPT model (generative pretrained transformer?)
- uploaded the csv file to Kaggle so that model can interact
- hardest part lol, had perplexity of 8, added 2 more epochs to increase accuracy,
kept microsft thing small and had to delete around 200 lines because memory issues during
training
